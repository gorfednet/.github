## gh-poll-guard.py (plan row 5.10)

A `PreToolUse` hook on Bash and Monitor. It refuses GitHub polling in code that runs:

- a `while`/`until` loop that calls `gh` or `review-status.mjs`;
- a counted `for` loop (`seq`, `{1..N}`) that calls them and sleeps;
- a `while`/`until` busy-wait (`do :; done`);
- `gh run watch` or `gh pr checks --watch` without `--interval 60`, and `watch … gh`.

Quoted text and heredocs written to a doc are data, so writing up or searching for a loop isn't refused. A string passed to `bash -c`, `eval` or `ssh`, and a heredoc fed to a shell or a `.sh` file, are code.

The refusal tells the session to start one `gh run watch <id> --interval 60 --exit-status` with `run_in_background`.

- Why: on 13 November 2026 the 5,000-an-hour quota hit 0 twice. Default-interval watchers and 3 session poll loops drained it, and one busy-wait spun a core for 3.5 hours.
- Settings entry: `gh-poll-guard.settings.json`, merged into the `hooks` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- Tests: `test/ghPollGuard.test.mjs`, run by the verification-kit workflow. The 3 real commands are in `test/fixtures/gh-poll-guard/`.
- It fails open. Bad input or an internal error lets the command run.
- Not covered: a script written with the Write tool and run by name, a shell function that wraps `gh`, zsh `repeat`, and `curl` to api.github.com.

The owner installs it after this merges: the hook goes in `~/.claude/hooks/` and the entry in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
